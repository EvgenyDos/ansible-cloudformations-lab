  Configure the system as follows:

  * user *stannis* exists, has its primary group *operators*, and configured shell as `/bin/bash`
  * all users have a command `lsall` which works as `ls -a` without creating such command on the local system
  * users of group *operators* have a command `cdwork` which changes current directory to `/projects/operators`
  * command `cdwork` is not a file on the system
  * users of group *operators* have permissions to write in `/projects/operators`
  * users of group *operators* cannot run more than ten (10) processes

  *Assuming that users have shell `/bin/bash`.*
