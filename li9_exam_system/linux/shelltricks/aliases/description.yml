  Configure the host system as follows:

  * User *stannis* exists, has its primary group *operators*, and configured shell as `/bin/bash`.
  * All users have a command `lsall` which works as `ls -a` without creating such command on the local system.
  * Users of group *operators* have a command `cdwork` which does this command  `cd /projects/operators`.
  * Command `cdwork` is not a file on the system.
  * Users of group *operators* have permissions to write in `/projects/operators`.
  * Users of group *operators* cannot run more than ten (10) processes.

  *Assuming that users have a shell `/bin/bash`.*
