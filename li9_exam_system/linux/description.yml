  ## Exam rules

  You need to be aware of the following rules:

    * All task results will be validated after system reboot.
    * All tasks will be validated using SSH via centos user. Do not make any changes in `/home/centos/.ssh/authorized_key` file.
    * You are not allowed to change any network settings like routes, ip addresses, firewall settings.
    * You are not allowed to change SELinux state from *"enforcing"*.


  ## Recommendations

    * Read all tasks and then start doing them.
    * First complete the most easier for you tasks.
    * Do not spend much time on doing a single task, you can return and finish it later.
    * Reboot the server to make sure that your changes persist and will not be lost after rebooting.
    * Partially completed tasks are not scored.
    * Read each task entirely before doing it.
    * Do not modify settings for user `centos`, any improper changes may affect the scoring process.
