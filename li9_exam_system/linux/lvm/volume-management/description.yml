title: LVM and file systems
description : |
  You should configure the system as described below.
  To complete this task look for an unused (unallocated) space on any block device and use it. Don't modify any existing volumes and file systems.

  1. Create a logical volume group *vgroup1*:
     * Size of the volume group should be *512 MiB*.
     * Size of a physical extent should be *2 MiB*.
     * Create a logical volume named *static-data*:
       - size of the logical volume should be *128 MiB*
       - create a file system with *ext4* type
       - the file system should be labeled as *STATIC-DATA*
       - the logical volume should be mounted as `/volumes/static-data` at a boot time
       - the file system should be mounted in *Read-Only* mode.
     * Create a logical volume named *database*:
       - size of the logical volume must be *384 MiB*
       - size of the logical volume must use all available space in the group
       - create a file system with *xfs* type
       - the file system should be labeled as *DATABASE*
       - logical volume *database* is mounted at a boot time to `/volumes/database` as EXT4 filesystem.
  2. Create a logical volume group *vgroup2*:
     * Size of the volume group is *1024 MiB*.
     * Size of a physical extent should be *4 MiB*.
     * Create a logical volume named *runtime-data*:
       - volume should take *512MiB* size of the volume group
       - create a file system with *xfs* type
       - the file system should be labeled as *RUNTIME-DATA*
       - when command `mount /volumes/runtime-data` is run it should mount volume as `/volumes/runtime-data`
       - it should not be mounted at a boot time.
 
  *Notes*:

    - Pay attention on a unit size. It is an important point.
    - This task may require to look for a free block device which is already attached to the exam system.
    - Do not use any used block devices.
