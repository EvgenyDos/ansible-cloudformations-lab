title: LVM and file systems
description : |
  You should configure the system as described below.
  To complete this task look for an unused (unallocated) space on any block device and use it. Don't modify any existing volumes and file systems.

  1. Create a logical volume group *vgroup1*:
     * Size of the volume group is *512 MiB*.
     * Size of a physical extent should be *2 MiB*.
     * Create a logical volume named *static-data*:
       - size of the logical volume is *128 MiB*
       - create a file system of type *ext4*
       - the file system should be labeled as *STATIC-DATA*
       - the logical volume should be mounted as `/volumes/static-data` at a boot time
       - the file system should mount in *Read-Only* mode.
     * Create a logical volume named *database*:
       - size of the logical volume is *384 MiB*
       - size of the logical volume gets all free space in the group
       - create a file system of type *xfs*
       - the file system should be labeled as *DATABASE*
       - *database* is mounted at a boot time to `/volumes/database` as EXT4 filesystem.
  2. Create a logical volume group *vgroup2*:
     * Size of the volume group is *1024 MiB*.
     * Size of a physical extent should be *4 MiB*.
     * Create a logical volume named *runtime-data*:
       - the volume should take *512MiB* of size of the volume group
       - create a file system of type *xfs*
       - the file system should be labeled as *RUNTIME-DATA*
       - when command `mount /volumes/runtime-data` is run it should mount the volume as `/volumes/runtime-data`
       - it should not mount at a boot time.
 
  *Notes*:

    - Pay attention on a unit size. It is an important point.
    - This task may require to look for a free block device which is already attached to the exam system.
    - Do not use any used block devices.
