title: LVM and Filesystems
description : |
  You should configure the system as described below.
  To complete this task look for an unused (unallocated) space on any block device and use it. Don't modify any existing volumes and file systems.

  * Volume *vgroup1*:
    * Size of the volume group is *512 MiB*.
    * Size of a physical extent should be *2 MiB*.
    * Has a logical volume named *static-data*:
      * size of the logical volume is *128 MiB*
      * the logical volume should be mounted as `/volumes/static-data` at a boot  time
      * the mounted file system should be available in *Read-Only* mode.
    * Has a logical volume named *database*:
      * size of the logical volume gets all free space in the group
      * *database* is mounted at boot to `/volumes/database` as EXT4 filesystem.
  * Logical group *vgroup2*:
    * Size of the volume group is *1024 MiB*.
    * Size of a physical extent should be *2 MiB*.
    * Has a logical volume named *runtime-data*:
      * the volume should take 100% of size of the volume group
      * when run a command `mount /volumes/runtime-data` it is mounted as `/volumes/runtime-data`.
 
  *Attention*: Pay attention on a unit size!

  *Note!* This task may require to look for a free block device which is already attached to the exam system.
  Do not use any used block devices.
