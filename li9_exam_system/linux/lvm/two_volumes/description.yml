  * Volume group named **examvg** exists.
  * Volume group extent size is **2M**.
  * Logical volume named **vol1** exists:

    * **vol1** belongs to the **examvg** volume group
    * Size is **200M**
    * **vol1** is mounted at boot to `/data/fs1` as EXT4 filesystem
    
  * Logical volume named **vol2** exists

    * **vol2** belongs to the **examvg** volume group
    * Size is **300M**
    * **vol2** is mounted at boot to `/data/fs2` as XFS filesystem

  Do not use any used block devices.
