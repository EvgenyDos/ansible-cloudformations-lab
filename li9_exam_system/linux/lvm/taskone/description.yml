        <li>Volume group extent size is <b>2M</b>
        <li>Logical volume named <b>“vol1”</b> exists
            <ul>
                    <li>“vol1” belongs to the <b>“examvg”</b> volume group
                    <li>Size is <b>200M</b>
                    <li>“vol1” is mounted at boot to /data/fs1 as EXT4 filesystem
            </ul>
        <li>Logical volume named <b>“vol2”</b> exists
            <ul>
                    <li>“vol2” belongs to the <b>“examvg”</b> volume group
                    <li>Size is <b>300M</b>
                    <li>“vol2” is mounted at boot to <b>/data/fs2</b> as XFS filesystem
