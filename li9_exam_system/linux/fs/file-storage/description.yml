title: File systems
description : |
  Construct a new file system on top of existing file system.

  An application needs a separate block device and a file system on it to run successfully. Host machine should not have any unused block devices. Configure your system as follows:

  * Create a file sized *512 MiB* as `/virtual-dev-storage`.
  * Create *Ext4* file system on it. Do not preserve any space for *root* user.
  * File system must be available as `/opt/virtual-storage`.
