title: File systems

  Constructing a new file system over existing file system.

  An application needs a separate block device and a file system on it to run successfully but the server does not have any unused block devices. Configure your system as follows:

  * Create a file sized *512 MiB* as /virtual-dev-storage.
  * Create *Ext4* file system on it. Do not preserve any space for *root* user.
  * do the file system available as `/opt/virtual-storage`.
