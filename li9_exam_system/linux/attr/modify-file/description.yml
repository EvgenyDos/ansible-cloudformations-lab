title: Modify a file
description : |
  There is an empty file `/data/message`.

  Modify the file `/data/message` as follows:
  * Owner should be set as *manager*
  * It should be owned by group *staff*.
  * Permissions should be set as:
    * owner=read,write,execute
    * group=read,write
    * other=nothing
    * existing content of the file cannot be modified
    * new content can be added
  * file should be renamed to `/data/message.fixed`
  * file should contain a single line *Updated*.
  * file `/data/message` should not exist

  *Note!*: The content of the file should remain unchanged.
explanation: |
  This file is protected as `chattr +i /data/message` and cannot be modified without clearing this flag.
  Permissions should be changed to `chattr -i +a /data/message`. To update other attributes use `chmod`, and 
  create group *staff* if it does not exist.
