title: Modify a file
description : |
  A Previous engineer has protected a file from modifications. Nobody knows what he did.

  Unlock and Modify the file `/data/message` as follows:

  * Owner should be set to *aria*.
  * It should be owned by group *stark*.
  * Permissions should be set as:
    * owner=read,write,execute
    * group=read,write
    * other=nothing
    * existing content of the file cannot be modified
    * new content can be added.
  * File should be renamed to `/data/message.fixed`.
  * File should contain a single line *Updated*.
  * File `/data/message` should not exist.

explanation: |
  This file is protected as `chattr +i /data/message` and cannot be modified without clearing this flag.
  Permissions should be changed to `chattr -i +a /data/message`. To update other attributes use `chmod`, and
  create group *staff* if it does not exist.
