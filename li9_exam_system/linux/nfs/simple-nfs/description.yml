title: NFS server
description : |
  Configure your system as NFS server with following requirements:

  * NFS service exports `/nfs_export` directory for anyone.
  * `/nfs_export` is exported in Read-Write mode.
  * Any NFS user should have Read-Write access to the share.
  * Each new file created on this shared folder from the remote hosts should be owned by user *nfsstore*.
  * On the NFS host machine, only user *nfsstore* should have read-write access to the files below `/nfs_export`. Other users should not have any permissions.
  * All created files and directories by NFS clients should be owned by *nfsstore* user.
